DroidWheel is an app that allows you to use sensors available in your android device to simulate steering wheel. Just mount your phone/tablet on any rotatable surface and you're good to go. App uses ViGemBus.

Caution: App might not work on devices without gyroscopes. You can check whether one is present in your phone by checking device specifications.

Installation:

1. Install virtual gamepad driver https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/tag/setup-v1.17.333
2. Download and install DroidWheel.apk on your android from here: https://github.com/danielwitkowsk/DroidWheel_releases/releases
3. Download DroidWheelServer.exe and Nefarius.ViGEm.Client.dll on Windows, make sure they are in the same folder
4. Start DroidWheelServer.exe
5. Make sure that phone is in the same network as the pc (meaning using the same router, or connected by USB/Wifi/Bluetooth tethering)
6. It's important that connected network in Windows settings is set as Public, not Private.
7. Use the listed IP from the DroidWheelServer.exe in phone application
8. Choose port, any open port will do (e. g. 8888, same port for both applications)
9. Should work!
